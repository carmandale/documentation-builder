# VisionOS Knowledge Base Implementation Checklist

## Primary Goal
Create a comprehensive, LLM-friendly knowledge base that enables **any** LLM code assistant to successfully generate working VisionOS code without prior VisionOS knowledge.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] An LLM with no prior VisionOS knowledge can generate working code
- [ ] Generated code follows Apple's best practices
- [ ] Code is properly structured and includes all necessary dependencies
- [ ] Implementation steps are clear and sequential
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases are addressed

## Knowledge Base Structure Checklist

- [ ] Prerequisites are explicitly stated
- [ ] Required imports and permissions are listed
- [ ] Component relationships are mapped
- [ ] Common pitfalls and solutions are documented

- [ ] Code templates are well-commented
- [ ] Validation rules are clear and testable

### 2. Component Relationships
- [ ] Clear hierarchy of components
- [ ] Dependencies between components
- [ ] Required vs optional relationships
- [ ] Common component combinations
- [ ] Integration patterns
- [ ] State management between components
- [ ] Communication patterns

### 3. Development Plans
- [ ] Template for common app types

- [ ] Navigation patterns

### 5. Validation and Testing
- [ ] Compile-time validation rules
- [ ] Runtime validation rules
- [ ] Common error scenarios
- [ ] Test templates
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Best practices validation

### 6. Documentation Quality
- [ ] Clear and consistent terminology
- [ ] Step-by-step guides
- [ ] Visual diagrams where helpful
- [ ] Cross-references between related patterns
- [ ] Version compatibility notes
- [ ] Platform-specific considerations

### 7. LLM Optimization
- [ ] Clear section markers
- [ ] Consistent formatting
- [ ] Explicit context boundaries
- [ ] Clear parameter descriptions
- [ ] Error recovery suggestions
- [ ] Alternative implementation paths

### 8. Maintenance and Updates
- [ ] Version tracking
- [ ] Deprecation notices
- [ ] Migration guides
- [ ] Breaking changes documentation
- [ ] Compatibility matrices
- [ ] Update procedures

## Core Rules
1. **Primary Rule**: Make the knowledge base consumable by ANY LLM without prior VisionOS knowledge
   - All information must be self-contained
   - All necessary context must be included
   - Implementation steps must be clear and sequential
   - No assumptions about prior knowledge

2. **Pattern Documentation Rules**:
   - Every pattern must have numbered implementation steps
   - All prerequisites must be explicitly stated
   - All dependencies (imports, permissions) must be listed
   - All component relationships must be documented
   - Best practices and common pitfalls must be included

3. **Code Generation Rules**:
   - Generated code must be immediately runnable
   - All necessary imports must be included
   - All required permissions must be handled
   - Must follow Apple's best practices
   - Must include error handling
   - Must be properly structured

4. **Documentation Rules**:
   - Must be clear and consistent
   - Must include validation rules
   - Must provide complete context
   - Must include practical examples
   - Must cross-reference related components
   - Must document edge cases

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Basic pattern system with Pydantic models
- [x] Enhanced pattern documentation structure
- [x] Component analyzer implementation
- [ ] Complete pattern database
- [ ] Development plan templates
- [ ] Code generation templates
- [ ] Validation system
- [ ] Testing framework
- [ ] Documentation system
- [ ] LLM optimization layer

## Next Steps
1. Complete the pattern database with enhanced documentation
2. Implement development plan templates
3. Create code generation templates
4. Build validation system
5. Develop testing framework
6. Optimize for LLM consumption
7. Create maintenance procedures

## Quality Metrics
- [ ] 100% of patterns have complete documentation
- [ ] All code templates compile successfully
- [ ] All validation rules are automated
- [ ] Test coverage > 90%
- [ ] Documentation coverage 100%
- [ ] No undefined dependencies
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] All error cases handled
