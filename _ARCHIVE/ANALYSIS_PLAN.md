# VisionOS Documentation Analysis Plan

## Project Objective
Create a comprehensive knowledge base that enables accurate code generation for VisionOS applications by understanding platform-specific patterns, APIs, and best practices.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Component Analysis System â¬œ
- [x] Implement ComponentAnalyzerAdapter
  - [x] Bridge to existing component analyzer
  - [x] Extract VisionOS-specific metadata
  - [x] Identify initialization patterns
  - [x] Store in enhanced format
- [ ] Test with sample components
- [ ] Validate metadata extraction
- [ ] Document component patterns

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis System 
- [ ] Implement PatternAnalyzerAdapter
  - [ ] Leverage existing pattern detection
  - [ ] Categorize patterns (spatial, interaction, lifecycle)
  - [ ] Extract pattern relationships
  - [ ] Store with validation rules
- [ ] Test pattern detection
- [ ] Validate relationship mapping
- [ ] Document pattern categories

### Phase 3: Knowledge Population 
- [ ] Process Apple documentation
  - [ ] Extract core components
  - [ ] Identify common patterns
  - [ ] Document best practices
  - [ ] Map constraints
- [ ] Analyze sample projects
- [ ] Validate extracted knowledge
- [ ] Document coverage

### Phase 4: Validation System 
- [ ] Implement validation rules
  - [ ] Component relationships
  - [ ] Required permissions
  - [ ] Framework dependencies
  - [ ] Device/OS compatibility
- [ ] Test validation system
- [ ] Document validation rules
- [ ] Create validation examples

## Success Metrics
1. Component Coverage
   - [ ] All core VisionOS components identified
   - [ ] Complete metadata for each component
   - [ ] Accurate relationship mapping

2. Pattern Accuracy
   - [ ] Correct pattern categorization
   - [ ] Valid relationship detection
   - [ ] Proper constraint identification

3. Code Generation Quality
   - [ ] Follows VisionOS patterns
   - [ ] Includes necessary setup
   - [ ] Handles permissions correctly
   - [ ] Manages resources properly
