# Technical Documentation

## System Components

### 1. Documentation Analyzer
- ✅ Scrapes documentation using Playwright
- ✅ Processes static content with BeautifulSoup
- ✅ Basic caching of results

### 2. Pattern Refinement
- ✅ Basic pattern detection from code examples
- ✅ Simple pattern validation
- 🚧 Advanced pattern refinement (Planned)
  ```python
  pattern_refiner = PatternRefiner()
  refined_patterns = pattern_refiner.analyze_existing_patterns(pattern_data)
  ```

### 3. Knowledge Base
- ✅ Basic JSON-based pattern storage
- ✅ Simple relationship tracking
- 🚧 Advanced Features (In Development):
  - LLM-optimized access
  - Complex relationship analysis
  - Pattern validation
- Current Usage:
  ```python
  knowledge_base = VisionOSKnowledgeBase()
  knowledge_base.build_from_analysis(pattern_data)
  ```

## Pattern Types
Each pattern type currently has:
- ✅ Basic regex-based detection
- ✅ Simple validation checks
- ✅ Basic confidence scoring
- ✅ Example storage

### Current Pattern Support
1. **UI Components** ✅
   - View hierarchies
   - SwiftUI integration
   - Basic component detection

2. **3D Content** ✅
   - Entity detection
   - Basic RealityKit integration
   - Scene structure analysis

3. **State Management** ✅
   - Property wrapper detection
   - Basic state flow analysis
   - Component relationships

4. **Advanced Features** 🚧
   - Semantic analysis (Planned)
   - Deep relationship tracking (In Development)
   - Context-aware validation (Planned)

## Development Guidelines
1. **Content Processing**
   - ✅ Use Playwright for dynamic content
   - ✅ Use BeautifulSoup for static parsing
   - ⚠️ Limited content validation currently implemented

2. **Error Handling**
   - ✅ Basic error logging
   - ✅ Simple fallbacks
   - 🚧 Advanced error recovery (Planned)
