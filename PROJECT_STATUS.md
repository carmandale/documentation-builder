# VisionOS Documentation Builder - Project Status

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive knowledge base and tooling for enabling **any** LLM to generate accurate VisionOS code without prior VisionOS knowledge. The system analyzes Apple's VisionOS documentation and sample code to build an LLM-optimized knowledge base that ensures generated code is functional and follows best practices.
