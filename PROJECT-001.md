### **Project Overview**

- **Objective**: Create a prototype visualization of ADCs attacking cancer cells for Pfizer, using VisionOS and Reality Composer Pro.
- **Environment**: An immersive space in VisionOS, combining 2D windows and 3D objects.

### **Components**

1. **User Interface**

   - **Attack Cancer Button**:
     - A 2D window with a button labeled "Attack Cancer" is visible at the start.
     - Upon clicking, the 2D window and button disappear.
     - Initiates the ADC launch sequence.

2. **ADC Launch Sequence**

   - **Dynamic Spline Path Generation**:
     - Generate a smooth, S-shaped B-spline dynamically in 3D space.
     - Path Characteristics:
       - Starts to the right of the user's head.
       - Moves approximately 1.5 meters forward, down, and curves toward the cancer cells.
     - **Path Variance**:
       - ADCs have slight deviations from the spline to enhance natural movement.
       - Implement adjustable variables for speed, rotation, and translation variance.
       - Variables should be exposed for easy tweaking.

3. **ADC Representation**

   - **Visuals**:
     - You will handle the creation of ADCs, either as 3D models or billboarded images with alpha channels.
     - Consider performance when deciding between models and billboards.
   - **Quantity**:
     - Start experimenting with quantities ranging from 10 to 100 ADCs.
     - Make the quantity an adjustable parameter.
   - **Audio**:
     - Spatial audio attached to ADCs.
     - You will create and integrate the audio assets.

4. **Cell Placement**

   - **Cell Types**:
     - **Healthy Cells**:
       - Visual distinction from cancer cells.
       - Quantity starts at 10 (adjustable variable).
     - **Cancer Cells**:
       - Visual distinction from healthy cells.
       - Quantity starts at 10 (adjustable variable).
       - Have predetermined transforms for ADC attachment.
   - **Placement Algorithm**:
     - Use sphere collision objects to prevent cells from overlapping.
     - Implement an offset variable to control cell spacing.
     - Ensure cells are tightly bunched but not penetrating each other.
     - Randomize positions within defined constraints.

5. **ADC and Cell Interaction**

   - **Collision Detection**:
     - ADCs detect collisions with cells.
     - **Healthy Cells**:
       - ADCs pass by without interaction.
     - **Cancer Cells**:
       - ADCs attach to cancer cells upon collision.
       - Attachment occurs at predetermined transforms on the cell surface.
       - Implement a material effect on the cancer cell upon attachment (e.g., glow or color change).
   - **Attachment Mechanics**:
     - Each cancer cell has multiple attachment points (transforms).
     - Once 50% of the transforms are occupied by ADCs, the cancer cell is marked for destruction.
     - The 50% threshold should be a variable for potential adjustment.

6. **Cancer Cell Destruction**

   - **Destruction Sequence**:
     - Upon reaching the ADC attachment threshold:
       - The cancer cell scales inward (shrinks) smoothly.
       - Triggers a particle system to create an explosion effect.
     - **Particle System**:
       - You will create and configure the particle effect.
     - **Audio**:
       - Spatial audio effect synchronized with the destruction.
       - You will create and integrate the audio assets.

7. **Performance Considerations**

   - **Optimization Strategies**:
     - Use instancing for rendering multiple ADCs and cells efficiently.
     - Implement Level of Detail (LOD) techniques if necessary.
     - Optimize collision detection:
       - Simplify collision shapes (e.g., bounding spheres).
       - Use spatial partitioning (like octrees) to reduce collision checks.
   - **Testing Parameters**:
     - Test different quantities of ADCs and cells to find optimal performance.
     - Adjust variance parameters to balance visual appeal and efficiency.
     - Monitor frame rates and resource usage during testing.

2. **Cell Placement and Interaction**
3. **Performance Testing with Variable Quantities**
4. **Basic User Interface Integration**

---

### **Prototype Development Steps**

#### **Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment**

- **VisionOS Project Initialization**:
  - Create a new VisionOS project using Reality Composer Pro.
  - Set up the immersive space where the 3D interactions will occur.
- **Version Control**:
  - Initialize a Git repository to track changes and collaborate efficiently.

#### **Step 2: Implement the Dynamic Spline Path**

- **Objective**: Create a dynamic spline path that ADCs will follow.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Generate a Basic Spline**:
    - Implement a function to create a smooth, S-shaped B-spline curve in 3D space.
    - Define control points that start from the right side of the user's head and curve toward a point in space representing the cancer cell cluster.
  - **Visualize the Spline** (optional for debugging):
    - Render the spline visibly to ensure it is generated correctly.
    - Use a simple line or series of connected points.

- **Considerations**:
  - Keep the spline simple initially; add complexity later if needed.
  - Ensure the spline generation is dynamic, allowing for adjustments.

#### **Step 3: Create a Basic ADC Prototype**

- **Objective**: Implement a simple representation of ADCs moving along the spline.

- **Tasks**:
  - **ADC Representation**:
    - Use a simple geometric shape (e.g., a sphere or cube) to represent ADCs.
    - This keeps the focus on movement and performance without concern for detailed models.
  - **ADC Movement Along the Spline**:
    - Instantiate multiple ADCs that move along the spline path.
    - Implement basic movement logic to interpolate ADC positions along the spline over time.
  - **Introduce Movement Variance**:
    - Add slight deviations in speed and position to each ADC to simulate natural movement.
    - Use adjustable parameters for speed variance and path deviation.

- **Considerations**:
  - Start with a small number of ADCs (e.g., 10) and gradually increase.
  - Ensure that variance parameters are easily adjustable for testing.

#### **Step 4: Implement Basic Cell Placement**

#### **Step 5: Develop Collision Detection and Interaction**

- **Objective**: Enable ADCs to detect and respond to collisions with cancer cells.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Simplify Collision Shapes**:
    - Use bounding spheres for both ADCs and cancer cells to simplify collision detection.
  - **Implement Collision Logic**:
    - On collision, have the ADC attach to the cancer cell.
    - Visually represent the attachment by having the ADC stop moving and stick to the cell.
  - **Track Attachments**:
    - Keep a count of ADCs attached to each cancer cell.
    - Set a simple threshold (e.g., 3 ADCs) to trigger cell destruction.

- **Considerations**:
  - Optimize collision detection by checking collisions only when ADCs are near the cell cluster.
  - Keep collision responses simple for the prototype.

#### **Step 6: Simulate Cancer Cell Destruction**

- **Objective**: Implement a basic visual effect for cancer cell destruction.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Destruction Trigger**:
    - When the attachment threshold is reached, remove the cancer cell from the scene.
  - **Visual Feedback**:
    - Implement a simple scaling animation to shrink the cancer cell before removal.
    - Optionally, change the cell's color to indicate it's being destroyed.

- **Considerations**:
  - Keep the destruction effect minimal to focus on core functionality.
  - Particle effects can be added later.

#### **Step 7: Integrate a Basic User Interface**

- **Objective**: Add the "Attack Cancer" button to initiate the ADC launch sequence.

- **Tasks**:
  - **Create a 2D UI Window**:
    - Add a simple 2D window with a single "Attack Cancer" button.
  - **Button Functionality**:
    - Upon clicking, the button disappears, and the ADCs begin moving along the spline.
    - Use a simple callback or event handler to trigger the sequence.

- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure the UI integrates smoothly with the immersive environment.
  - Keep the UI minimal for the prototype.

#### **Step 8: Performance Testing**
