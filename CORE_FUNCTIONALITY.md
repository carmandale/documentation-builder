# Core Functionality Tracker

## 1. URL Discovery and Processing ✅
- **get_documentation_links()** ✅
  - Successfully finds and categorizes URLs
  - Uses Playwright for dynamic content
  - Uses BeautifulSoup for static parsing
  - Categories: documentation, videos, other

- **analyze_documentation_structure()** ✅
  - Successfully analyzes page structure
  - Finds sections, topics, and samples
  - Uses BeautifulSoup for static analysis

## 2. Sample Detection and Processing ✅
- **process_documentation_page()** ✅
  - Uses Playwright selectors for dynamic content
  - Successfully finds downloadable samples
  - Returns ProjectResource with title, URL, and download info

- **download_project()** ✅
  - Successfully downloads projects
  - Creates sanitized directory names
  - Handles zip file extraction

## 3. Documentation Content Extraction ✅
- **extract_documentation_content()** ✅
  - Extracts structured content from pages
  - Caches documentation for reuse
  - Captures code samples and context
  - Stores related topics and concepts

## 4. Caching System ✅
- **Cache Types**
  - URL cache for discovered links
  - Samples cache for found projects
  - Documentation cache for extracted content
  - Analysis cache for processed results

- **Cache Validation** ✅
  - Age-based validation (24 hour default)
  - Format validation
  - Content integrity checks
  - Automatic cache updates

## 5. Pattern Analysis ✅
- **Supported Patterns**
  - 3D Content
  - UI Components
  - Animations
  - Gestures
  - Immersive Spaces
  - Spatial Audio
  - ARKit

### Adding New Patterns
1. Add pattern type to `PATTERN_TYPES` in `core/config.py`
2. Add pattern matching terms to `pattern_matches()` in `analyzers/project_analyzer.py`
3. Pattern matching uses simple string detection:
```python
patterns = {
    'pattern_name': [
        'term1',
        'term2',
        'term3'
    ]
}
```

All patterns follow the same simple structure - just add the terms you want to detect.

## 6. Knowledge Base System ✅
- **VisionOSKnowledgeBase**
  - Integrates with existing cache system
  - Uses validated patterns from analysis
  - Provides structured access to relationships
  - Optimizes data for LLM consumption

- **Knowledge Types**
  - Pattern knowledge (from pattern analysis)
  - Relationship knowledge (from relationship tracker)
  - Implementation examples (from samples)
  - Documentation context (from doc extractor)

## 7. Current Focus
1. Enhance documentation content extraction
2. Improve pattern detection accuracy
3. Expand relationship tracking
4. Optimize cache management

## 8. Testing Requirements
- Run verify.sh before changes
- Test with both cache enabled/disabled
- Verify sample downloads work
- Check pattern analysis results
