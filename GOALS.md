my goal is to be able to give a good LLM code assistant information that will help it be more effective. Vision OS and SwiftUI are relatively new and a lot of the LLMs have not been trained on the latest info, so they are not very helpful. I want to be able to give them data that will help them be more effective. and while I am focused on VisionOS and SwiftUI, I want the documentation builder tool that we are building to be useful for other projects too. So, for example, one technique in VisionOS is to be able to add attachments to 3D models in an immersive view, and I want to be able to give the LLM the relevant documentation and have it effectively give me code to be able to do that. Currently, all of the LLMs can't give me useful code for that since it is so new.

with this objective in mind, and hopefully that was already clear, but maybe this helps, do you think we are on the right track? and what would you recommend to improve what we are doing? and would firecrawl be helpful at all?
